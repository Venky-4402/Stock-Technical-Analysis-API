# Testing Strategy

This brief outlines the testing approach used for the Kalpi Technical Indicator API, ensuring correctness, security, and compliance with tiered subscription requirements.

## 1. Automated Unit and Integration Tests

- **Unit tests** cover core logic for indicator calculations (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) using sample data to verify mathematical correctness.
- **Integration tests** use FastAPIâ€™s TestClient to simulate real HTTP requests, validating end-to-end API behavior including authentication, authorization, and response formatting.

## 2. Tier and Rate Limiting Validation

- **Tier-based access tests** confirm that Free, Pro, and Premium users can only access endpoints and data ranges allowed by their subscription.
- **Rate limiting tests** simulate exceeding daily request quotas and verify correct 429 (Too Many Requests) responses.
- **Forbidden access tests** ensure that attempts to access restricted indicators or data ranges return 403 errors.

## 3. Security and Error Handling

- **Authentication tests** check that endpoints require valid JWT tokens and reject invalid or expired tokens with 401 responses.
- **Input validation tests** submit malformed or incomplete requests to ensure the API returns appropriate 422 errors.
- **Edge case tests** include invalid dates, unknown symbols, and boundary conditions for indicator parameters.

## 4. Caching and Performance

- **Cache hit/miss tests** verify that repeated requests for the same indicator and parameters are served from cache, improving response times.
- **Performance checks** ensure the API responds efficiently under typical and peak loads.

## 5. Manual and Exploratory Testing

- Used Swagger UI to manually test endpoints, try different scenarios, and visually inspect request/response examples.
- Verified API documentation accuracy and usability.

## 6. Continuous Testing

- All tests are run automatically with each code change to ensure ongoing correctness and prevent regressions.

This comprehensive approach ensures the API is robust, secure, and behaves correctly for all user tiers and scenarios.
